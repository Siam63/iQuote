Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier.", "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.", "Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.", "Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else.", "The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart."]
